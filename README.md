# WCL Ranking Tooltip

WCL Ranking Tooltip is a World of Warcraft addon designed for the Classic version, enhancing player tooltips by displaying WarcraftLogs data directly in-game for the Benediction server. It provides players with quick insights into rankings, performance metrics, and other key statistics, all without leaving the game environment.

## Features

- **Tooltip Enhancement:** Adds a line to player tooltips showing Parse Percentage, All-Star Points, and Spec (or Spec Icon), with class color coding.
- **Customizable Display:** Options pane allows users to toggle the display of verbose data and select their preferred data points.
- **Future-Proof:** Designed with extensibility in mind to support additional servers and data points in future versions.

## Installation

1. **Download the Addon:** Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/kikootwo/WCLRankingTooltip/releases) page.
2. **Extract the ZIP File:** Unzip the downloaded file into your World of Warcraft `_classic_/Interface/AddOns` directory.
3. **Verify Installation:** Launch World of Warcraft Classic, and from the character select screen, click on "AddOns" to ensure "WCL Ranking Tooltip" is listed and enabled.

## Usage

- **Hover Over Players:** Simply hover over any player character to see their WarcraftLogs data in the tooltip.
- **Customize Display:** Access the Interface Options menu (`ESC` > Interface > AddOns > WCL Ranking Tooltip) to customize which data points are displayed.

## Configuration

The addon includes an options pane located in the WoW Interface options menu. Here, you can:

- Enable/disable verbose data display when holding the 'Shift' key.
- Adjust class color settings and other visual preferences. (Note: Future versions aim to support data sets for additional servers.)
